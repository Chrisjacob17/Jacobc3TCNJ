            <h3>Who am I?</h3>

            <p> I was born on December 1, 2000 in Flemington, NJ. I grew up in a small rural area of New Jersey with my Mom, Dad, and older sister (and with some pets of course). I graduated from Delaware Valley Regional High School in 2019 and I am now attending The College of New Jersey as a Interactive Multimedia Major. I have played soccer since I was 5 years old, Arsenal and Real Madrid fan, unfortunately, and I am a die hard New York Giants fan. I work as a busser at Holly Hedge Estates and am a memeber of my school club soccer team. </p>

            <h3>How did I start?</h3>

            <p> I started doing photography at a very young age, beginning with just a disposable camera. I remember being thrilled with taking photos on the crank disposables my parents would buy and awaiting my results in the mail. By no means were these photos good, in fact, most were just nonsense images of things around me and my family. However, taking the photos and looking at the final product is what intrigued me. I was eventually gifted a digital camera where I also took nonsene photos but I got the image back faster. As I got older, smart phones came out, and I got my first one in the 6th grade. This is when I started to see the photos in my head. What I mean by that is, I am able to see the photo in my head before I take it, I am able to visualize the angle and lighting before I even take it. I would use my iPhone 4s to take photos of sunsets and clouds. I also was gifted a new digital camera, where I played with depth of field and different angles. I would take my parents iPhones because they would have a better camera and take photos I saw on the spot. I was always given compliments on my photos at a young age, and it made me feel good to hear that a photo I took for fun were actually appreciated. </p>

            <h3>High School and Beyond</h3>

            <p> I would say the first time I was given a quality camera was sophmore year of high school. I took intro to photography where I learned how to use a Canon EOS Rebel T6. I learned many different styles of photography from the basic elements like lines, rule of thirds, shape, movement, etc. to manuel focus, self-protraits, and my favorite, abstract. I would like to say I am self-taught considering I never payed attention, but I feel figuring out what works is the best way to take the best shot. I took photography II the next semester of my sophomore where I continued learning more and more. I was absent from photography until my senior year where I took advanced photography. I was very stubborn with what photography I enjoyed doing, and I disliked assignments that involved too much planning because too me it comes naturally. Planning and photoshop type photography seemed too fake or forced to me. I enjoyed "open" assignments that I could explore anything and think on the fly. We were assigned a semester long portfolio of anything of our choice. I decided to do something with fire as I believed fire was very aesthetic and abstract. This is where I took some of my favorite photos. Now in college, I am waiting for an opportunity to get involved with photography again.
